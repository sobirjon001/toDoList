# Welcome to To Do List Project

you can see markdown syntax [here](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/blob/master/docs/MARKDOWN_SYNTAX.md)

Dear students, this is a sand box project for students to play around and exercise SDLC of projects. Here we will touch Soft Skills and Java experience to practice concepts of SDLC and show students in very easy and understandable steps. Of course this project does not represent the real world practice of IT companies, so please don't judge strictly :)

This README.md file has full information on dynamics of this project. I also want to touch a bit concepts of different environments that different actions and work flow are happen. Each environment will be presented on different branches: developers, QA, production and previous versions will come by version names.

Our SDLC cycle here on this document missing states like `Design`, `Product Backlog` and other. This parts where covered on our video session [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwuUlKBEvMs&list=PLbbvno2B8AMsC8T3eM1aHkSFvOzWjq53t&index=7). Please watch if you missed. As I've explained on video since this project is small we didn't go through all steps. So what we have here `System Requirements Specification Document` as an output from `Requirements Gathering` step and `Sprint Backlog` as an output of `Design` step. As you can see below we have two versions. They represent dynamics, where based on end user feedback, bugs reports, new features from client new SDLC starts. SDLC's are presented in different environment.

  - Create logic for checking invalid entry on menu
  - Display message that invalid entry entered and ask user to try again and reload current page

### What is environment?
[content](#content)

A software environment for a particular application could include the operating system, the database system, specific development tools or compiler.
Based on function members of scrum team have their own environment where they store their work and do their assigned tasks. As every unit or piece of work or projects gets ready in one environment it goes to next environment for further work before deployment or release.

### Developers environment
[content](#content)

An development environment provides developers an interface and convenient view of the development process which includes writing code, testing the same and packaging the build so that it can be deployed.
Examples for Development Environment
  - Intelije IDE
  - Microsoft Visual Studio
  - Eclipse
  - Netbeans
  - Adobe Flex Builder
Here developers create their code and run unit and integration test

### QA environment
[content](#content)

This environment is used by testers, QA analysts or other testing professionals to perform many forms of functional and non-functional testing, such as end-to-end testing, load testing, smoke testing, regression testing, and more. It's always best to wave more than one QA/Testing environments to get more necessary possible automated test cases as a better assurance of lesser bug project.

### Staging/preproduction environment
[content](#content)

This is essentially a copy of the production environment. Itâ€™s meant to be as close as possible to production, so the team can verify if the application will behave correctly after its deployment.

### Deployment
[content](#content)

At this state version of project or release is being on the market, used by end users. This version of project passed as mush as possible tests and is in the best as possible state. Of course as a continuous maintenance all bug reports, user feedback and new feature requests are accepted for next SDLC of the project
