1. Dec 8 2020 Good Day @Jair Novello! Thank you for taking efford to improve our project! I've seen all your fixes. I tried to create this projects as simple as possible for students to follow. But now as we done I couldn't help myself and added even more improvements and if you dont mind I've changed your if's to while's to make sure user don't make more invalid entries. Please have a look and feel free to add even more features. I'm expecting other volunteeres to join to work on testing part of this project. Thank you again!
